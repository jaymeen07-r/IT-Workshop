## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**  
  - Uses `form`, `fieldset`, `legend`, `label`, `input`, `select`, `option`, and `textarea` to structure and group the form elements. [web:33][web:38]  
- **Inline Styling**  
  - Basic inline `style` applied on `fieldset` and `legend` for simple visual grouping and improved readability. [web:21]

## Possible Improvements

- Move inline styles into a separate **CSS file** for better maintainability and responsive design. [web:24]  
- Add **client-side validation** using JavaScript for mobile number, email, and required selections. [web:25]  
- Standardize and correct `id` and `name` attributes (avoid dots in names and duplicate IDs for radio buttons) to follow best HTML practices. [web:34][web:38]  
- Improve accessibility by ensuring every `label` correctly references a unique input via the `for` and `id` attributes. [web:33]
